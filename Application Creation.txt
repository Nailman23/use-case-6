Hi, my name is Slawek and I am DevOps Engineer working on some project. I have to set up cloud infrastructure of 1 unattached disk, 2 non-encrypted disks, 3 non-encrypted snapshots on AWS. The next step is to provision and set up serverless infrastructure in cloud environment. The objective of this use case is to design and develop a serverless application that collects specific infrastructure metrics. The acceptnace criteria are:
The function is created by using Python. 
The function has a role with permissions to collect metrics and write them to a storage. 
The function is tested and verified to collect the required metrics once a day using cloud SDK (for scheduling in AWS use AWS EventBridge). 
The function stores the collected metrics as JSON files in cloud storage (S3).
The storage is configured with encryption, lifecycle policies, and access control. 
Quality Details:  
All commented code is removed from the project.  
Proper exception handling is incorporated in the code.  
Passwords or other secrets are not visible as plain text in the code.  
Sensitive logs are appropriately suppressed.  
Hardcoding of values is avoided. 
Write Python code that collects the metrics from the number and overall size of unattached disk volumes, not encrypted disk volumes, and not encrypted snapshots. 
Deploy the code to the serverless service. 
Configure a schedule to run the serverless service once a day. 
Configure permissions to collect metrics and to store them in a storage service. 
ChatGPT
To achieve the outlined goals, you can follow the below steps. This guide will cover creating the AWS Lambda function, the necessary IAM role and permissions, scheduling the function using AWS EventBridge, and storing the collected metrics in an encrypted S3 bucket.

Step 1: Setting up an S3 bucket
Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
Create a new bucket with encryption enabled.
Configure bucket lifecycle policies if needed.
Step 2: Create an IAM role
Go to the IAM console and create a new role.
Attach the following managed policies:
AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess: This will give permissions to read EC2 metrics.
AmazonS3FullAccess: To write to S3. (Fine-tune permissions for security.)
Step 3: Create the AWS Lambda function
Here is a sample Python function that collects the desired metrics:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
    
    # Get all volumes
    all_volumes = ec2_client.describe_volumes()
    
    unattached_volumes = [v for v in all_volumes['Volumes'] if not v['Attachments']]
    non_encrypted_volumes = [v for v in all_volumes['Volumes'] if not v['Encrypted']]
    
    # Get non-encrypted snapshots
    non_encrypted_snapshots = ec2_client.describe_snapshots(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}])
    
    metrics = {
        "unattached_volumes_count": len(unattached_volumes),
        "non_encrypted_volumes_count": len(non_encrypted_volumes),
        "non_encrypted_snapshots_count": len(non_encrypted_snapshots['Snapshots']),
    }

    # Upload to S3
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    s3_bucket = "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
    s3_key = "metrics_{}.json".format(context.aws_request_id)
    
    s3_client.put_object(Body=json.dumps(metrics), Bucket=s3_bucket, Key=s3_key)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(metrics)
    }
Replace YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME with your S3 bucket name.

Navigate to the Lambda console.
Create a new function.
Assign the IAM role created in Step 2.
Paste the Python code.
Test the function to ensure it works as expected.
Step 4: Schedule the function using AWS EventBridge
Navigate to the EventBridge console.
Create a new rule.
Set the event source as a schedule, e.g., cron(0 12 * * ? *) to run once a day.
Set the target as the Lambda function created in Step 3.
Step 5: Finalize
Ensure that your code does not have hardcoded values or passwords. Test thoroughly to make sure the setup works as expected.

You should now have a serverless setup in AWS that collects metrics once a day about unattached and non-encrypted volumes and snapshots, and stores the results in an encrypted S3 bucket.

Suggest bucket lifecycle policies for storing logs
ChatGPT
Bucket lifecycle policies enable automated transitioning of objects between different storage classes or automatically expire them. For logs, lifecycle policies can be especially useful to help save costs and manage storage efficiently.

Here are suggested bucket lifecycle policies for storing logs in an S3 bucket:

Transition to Infrequent Access (IA) Storage Class:

Transition logs older than 30 days to the STANDARD_IA storage class. This is suitable for logs that you don't access frequently but still might need to access occasionally. It offers a cost savings compared to the STANDARD storage class.
Transition to Glacier:

Transition logs older than 90 days to Glacier for archival. Amazon Glacier is suitable for data that you can wait several hours to retrieve, and it's more cost-effective than STANDARD_IA for long-term storage.
Transition to Glacier Deep Archive:

Transition logs older than 180 days to Glacier Deep Archive. This is the most cost-effective storage class and suitable for logs that you're retaining for compliance purposes and expect to seldom, if ever, access.
Expiration:

Delete logs older than 365 days. If you're certain you won't need logs after a year, it's efficient to set an expiration lifecycle policy to automatically delete them and prevent unnecessary storage costs. Adjust this timeframe based on your organization's log retention policies and regulatory requirements.
Clean up incomplete multipart uploads:

Set a policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days. Multipart uploads can be a hidden cost because incomplete uploads that aren't cleaned up can accumulate and lead to increased storage costs over time.
Setting up Lifecycle Policy in S3 Console:

Navigate to your S3 bucket.
Click on "Management" and then "Lifecycle".
Click "Add lifecycle rule".
Provide a name for the rule.
For "Scope", you can select "Limit the scope of the rule by prefix/tags" if you only want the rule to apply to specific objects.
In the "Transitions" section, set the desired days for transitioning to STANDARD_IA, Glacier, and Glacier Deep Archive.
In the "Expirations" section, set the desired days for object expiration and enable cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads.
Review and save the rule.
Remember to always review your lifecycle policies in accordance with your company's data retention and access requirements. Adjust the above policy recommendations as necessary to match your specific needs and compliance requirements.

Suggest lambda policy to allow create log group
ChatGPT
To allow a Lambda function to create a log group, you need to grant it permissions to the logs:CreateLogGroup action. Below is an IAM policy that provides the necessary permissions:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:*"
        }
    ]
}
Replace <REGION> with the AWS region (e.g., us-west-1) and <ACCOUNT_ID> with your AWS account ID.

To attach this policy to your Lambda function:

Navigate to the IAM console.
Click on "Policies" in the left sidebar and then click the "Create policy" button.
Switch to the JSON tab and paste the above JSON policy.
Review and name the policy.
Attach this policy to the IAM role that your Lambda function assumes.
After attaching this policy, the Lambda function will have the necessary permissions to create log groups in CloudWatch Logs.

Remember: It's a good practice to follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant permissions that are necessary for the Lambda function to operate. If the function also needs to write logs, you might need to add permissions for logs:CreateLogStream and logs:PutLogEvents as well.

Suggest the lambda policy to allow use the  SSE-S3 key 
ChatGPT
If you're using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) for your objects in S3, AWS Lambda will need permissions to use those keys to read and/or write data.

Here's a suggested IAM policy that allows a Lambda function to use the SSE-S3 key for encryption when writing to an S3 bucket:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Replace <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME> with the name of your S3 bucket.

The above policy does the following:

Allows the Lambda function to PutObject (write) and GetObject (read) in the specified S3 bucket.
Uses a condition to ensure that the PutObject action uses the AES256 encryption (which corresponds to SSE-S3).
To attach this policy to your Lambda function:

Navigate to the IAM console.
Click on "Policies" in the left sidebar and then click the "Create policy" button.
Switch to the JSON tab and paste the above JSON policy.
Review and name the policy.
Attach this policy to the IAM role that your Lambda function assumes.
By following these steps, your Lambda function will have the permissions necessary to use the SSE-S3 key when accessing the specified S3 bucket.

The suggested python code does not work. The lamba timeouts without any errors in cloudwatch and cloudtrail. Could you suggest what can be the issue?
ChatGPT
If your Lambda function is timing out without any errors in CloudWatch and CloudTrail, there are several common possibilities to investigate:

Lambda Timeout Setting:

First, ensure that the timeout for your Lambda function is set appropriately. Depending on how much data you're processing or fetching, you might need to increase the timeout.
Navigate to your Lambda function in the AWS Console, and under the "Configuration" tab, look for the "General configuration". Here you can adjust the "Timeout" setting.
VPC Configuration:

If your Lambda is inside a VPC, ensure it has access to the necessary AWS services. For example, Lambda functions in a VPC will not have internet access by default, which means they cannot reach AWS services that are outside of the VPC.
To fix this, you can:
Add a NAT Gateway to your VPC and ensure your function's security group allows the necessary outbound access.
Or, if the Lambda doesn't need to be in a VPC (for accessing RDS, ElastiCache, etc.), you can remove it from the VPC.
IAM Role Permissions:

Ensure that the IAM role attached to the Lambda function has the necessary permissions for all the actions in your code (e.g., ec2:DescribeVolumes, s3:PutObject, etc.).
Even if you don't see an error in CloudWatch, a permissions issue might manifest as the function just waiting until it times out, especially if it's waiting for a response.
Code Logic & External Dependencies:

Ensure there are no infinite loops or logic in the code that could cause it to hang.
If your code depends on any external services or resources, verify that they are available and responsive. A non-responsive external service could cause the function to hang until timeout.
Logging:

Add more detailed logging throughout your Lambda code to trace the execution flow. This can help identify where it's getting stuck.
For example, after each major operation or AWS API call in your function, insert a log statement. This way, when you review the CloudWatch logs, you can see the last successful operation before the timeout.
Memory and Concurrency:

Sometimes, increasing the allocated memory can help, especially if the function is getting close to its memory limit. More memory also provides more CPU and network bandwidth.
If you're invoking multiple Lambdas concurrently, ensure that you're not hitting the concurrency limit.
Cold Starts:

In some cases, the first invocation (cold start) of a Lambda function can take longer, especially if it's inside a VPC. If you find cold starts to be an issue, you can implement provisioned concurrency to keep a specified number of function instances initialized.
Lastly, even though you mentioned there were no errors in CloudTrail, it's always good to double-check. Sometimes API calls that are denied due to permissions issues will appear in CloudTrail logs.

Once you've investigated these areas, you should have a clearer picture of what might be causing the timeout, and you can take appropriate corrective action.
